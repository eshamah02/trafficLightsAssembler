title  "trafficLights"
;
; A program that uses subroutines and loops to simulate a traffic light intersection system on a roundabout
;
; Hardware Notes:
; PIC16F684 running at 4 MHz
;   Inputs:
;		
;   Outputs:
;	RC0, RC1, RC2	- outputs, 3x2 LED's (3 pairs of red, yellow, green)
;			- turn first to indicate bridge moving
;			- called 'north' to refer to the stoplights on the north end of the roundabout
;	RC3, RC4, RC5	- outputs, 3x3 LED's (3 sets of 3 red, yellow, green)
;			- turn second to stop cars on roundabout
;			- called 'south' to refer to the stoplights on the south, east, and west ends of the roundabout
